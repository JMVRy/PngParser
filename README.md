# PNG Parser
This is just a simple repo for me to create a PNG parsing C# project. I just wanna be able to open a PNG image, get all the data from within, and possibly even create PNG images from scratch.

## Usage
```r
$ PngParser.exe
wow cool output goes here!
$
```

## Building
1. Clone the repo (`git clone` or download from ZIP)
2. Run `dotnet build`
3. Done!

## Contributing
Open an issue or a pull request. It will get reviewed and possibly committed to the repo.
